# Assignment: T04: Adventure in Gitland
#
# Purpose: To recreate a choose-your-own-adventure style game
# by refactoring T01.
#
# Each "twist" in the story is from a different group. The resulting story
# will either be incoherently random, or entertainingly "Mad Lib" like.
# Either way, it should be fun!
#
# This new version will take advantage of functions, as well as
# demonstrate the value of git as a tool for collaborating.
