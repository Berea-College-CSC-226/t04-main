# Adventure To Gitland

## Instructions

**Replace each `**Replace This With Your Answer**` with your answer**


## SECTION 1:

1.a. Discuss with your partner two or more ways in which you've improved as a coder since T01. You can refer back to t01_final_story.py for "inspiration".

```        
    ** We've started grouping everything into functions. We've learned to work implement other people's code into our program. **
```


1.b. Briefly describe any logic changes you made in your code, and why you made them.

```
    ** No logic changes since it was all conditionals. **
```


1.c. Did you find it challenging following the logic of another group’s code? Why or why not?

```
    ** It was harder than reading code written by oneself at first. **
```


1.d. Briefly describe two or more of the PEP8 warnings you fixed. Does the resulting code look better or worse? Why?

```
    ** We updated an expression to use the is keyword instead of == "if dead is True:" as stated per PEP8 warnings.
    We put two blank lines between every function.
    **
```

## SECTION 2:

2.a. You should notice that there are multiple branches in the Github repository. Find yours and check that your code is there. 
     Compare your branch to master. What’s different?

```        
    ** There are 47 branches. Our branch is different from the master because it has our edits to our file. **
```


2.b. Do you see other groups’ branches in the repo as well? Is your code in their branch? Why or why not?

```        
    ** Their code is not in our branch. The codebase has not been merged with everyone else's code.**
```


2.c. Next, issue a pull request (this is done by clicking on "New Pull Request" button in the browser on Github). 
     A pull request is a formal request to add your code into the master branch, for all to see and share. 
     Once you’ve issued the pull request, communicate to the instructor that you are "ready for a PR review."
     After the instructor or TA approves your request, refresh Github. 
     Is your code in the master branch now? 

```
    ** Our code is still not in the master branch since the instructor has not approved our merge. We've gone back and forth based on his feedback.**
```


2.d. What about other groups’ code? Is it also in master branch, compared to the last time you looked at it in Question 2.b.?

```
** Yes, there's a lot more code from other teams in the master branch now. **
```


2.e. Once your code has been pulled into the master branch, go back to PyCharm. 
     Right-click on the directory, and switch back to the master branch by clicking 
     **Git** >> **Branches** and selecting **Local Branches** >> **Master**.
     Is your code in your **local** master branch? Why not?

```
    ** Everyone's code dissapeared when we accessed the local master branch. Because the project wasn't updated there.**
```

Git can be challenging to wrap your head around when you’re first learning it, 
especially when collaboration becomes a part of the process. 
So, let’s make sure we understand the basic terms; 
the details of using git will be touched upon again in your homework assignment, in more detail. 

2.f. Define Each Term:
```
        a. Clone: copying a remote repository to your local machine by creating a local copy of the project's code and its entire version history.

        b. Commit: A commit is a snapshot of changes made to a file or set of files in the project.

        c. Push: The process of uploading our local commits to a remote repository, making our changes available to others. It helps in backing up our work.

        d. Branch: Branch is an independent line of development within a repository. It allows us to work on different features or bug fixes in isolation from the main codebase.

        e. Pull: The process of fetching changes from a remote repository and merging them into our local repository is known as Pull.

        f. Pull Request: It is  a request to merge changes from one branch into another branch, often the main branch, in a remote repository.

        g. Merge: The process of combining  the changes from one branch into another is known as merge.

        h. Remote:  A remote is a version of the repository that is hosted on a server, typically a service like GitHub or GitLab.

        i. Local: Local refers to the copy of the repository that resides on our personal computer. This is where we make changes and commit them before pushing them to the remote repository.

        j. Fetch: The process of downloading changes and updates from the remote repository without merging them into our local branch is Fetch.
```

Check your definitions against the [git glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) to ensure they are correct.

11. In Github, go to the [Network Graph](https://github.com/Berea-College-CSC-226/t04-master/network) (i.e., a history of branching and committing history). 
    Discuss with your partner what confusions you still have about the git workflow you experienced today, 
    using the network graph to explore what has happened. Write your unanswered questions in the space below:

```
    ** We were just confused with the time we made changes to the wront python file and had to revert everything.  **
```
