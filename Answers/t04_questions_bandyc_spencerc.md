# Adventure To Gitland

## Instructions

**Replace each `**Replace This With Your Answer**` with your answer**


## SECTION 1:

1.a. Discuss with your partner two or more ways in which you've improved as a coder since T01. You can refer back to t01_final_story.py for "inspiration".

```        
    We are better at understanding if elif and else statements. We know how to use functions now.
```


1.b. Briefly describe any logic changes you made in your code, and why you made them.

```
    We cleaned up unnecessary statements and made sure each input leads to a logical conclusion.
```


1.c. Did you find it challenging following the logic of another group’s code? Why or why not?

```
    Yes, it took a little while to understand the flow of the conditional statements and why they were that way.
```


1.d. Briefly describe two or more of the PEP8 warnings you fixed. Does the resulting code look better or worse? Why?

```
    We put more notation on what our code is actually doing. We removed redundant lines of code and made sure all the indentations were correct. We got rid of any squigglies. The code looks better now.
```

## SECTION 2:

2.a. You should notice that there are multiple branches in the Github repository. Find yours and check that your code is there. 
     Compare your branch to master. What’s different?

```        
    Our branch is there. It's different in the fact that it has our commits/pushes which the master branch does not have.
```


2.b. Do you see other groups’ branches in the repo as well? Is your code in their branch? Why or why not?

```        
    We see other branches from other groups. Our code is not in their branches. That is their own environment to work on using master as a baseline. If we were pulled into master and they updated their branch using master our code could be in their branch.
```


2.c. Next, issue a pull request (this is done by clicking on "New Pull Request" button in the browser on Github). 
     A pull request is a formal request to add your code into the master branch, for all to see and share. 
     Once you’ve issued the pull request, communicate to the instructor that you are "ready for a PR review."
     After the instructor or TA approves your request, refresh Github. 
     Is your code in the master branch now? 

```

```


2.d. What about other groups’ code? Is it also in master branch, compared to the last time you looked at it in Question 2.b.?

```

```


2.e. Once your code has been pulled into the master branch, go back to PyCharm. 
     Right-click on the directory, and switch back to the master branch by clicking 
     **Git** >> **Branches** and selecting **Local Branches** >> **Master**.
     Is your code in your **local** master branch? Why not?

Git can be challenging to wrap your head around when you’re first learning it, 
especially when collaboration becomes a part of the process. 
So, let’s make sure we understand the basic terms; 
the details of using git will be touched upon again in your homework assignment, in more detail. 

2.f. Define Each Term:
```
        a. Clone:____________________

        b. Commit:____________________

        c. Push:____________________

        d. Branch:____________________

        e. Pull:____________________

        f. Pull Request:____________________

        g. Merge:____________________

        h. Remote:____________________

        i. Local:____________________

        j. Fetch:____________________
```

Check your definitions against the [git glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) to ensure they are correct.

11. In Github, go to the [Network Graph](https://github.com/Berea-College-CSC-226/t04-master/network) (i.e., a history of branching and committing history). 
    Discuss with your partner what confusions you still have about the git workflow you experienced today, 
    using the network graph to explore what has happened. Write your unanswered questions in the space below:
