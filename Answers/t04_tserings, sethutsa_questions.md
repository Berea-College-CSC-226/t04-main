# Adventure To Gitland

## Instructions

**Replace each `**Replace This With Your Answer**` with your answer**


## SECTION 1:

1.a. Discuss with your partner two or more ways in which you've improved as a coder since T01. You can refer back to t01_final_story.py for "inspiration".

```        
    We learned to organize code in functions. We learned how to test and debug. We learned to import and use modules. We also got better at using for loops to do repetitive actions.
```


1.b. Briefly describe any logic changes you made in your code, and why you made them.

```
    We added input validation to ensure only valid binary usernames are accepted.
```


1.c. Did you find it challenging following the logic of another group’s code? Why or why not?

```
 Yeah, it was a bit tricky to follow because the logic was a little scattered, which made it tough to keep track of what was happening.
```


1.d. Briefly describe two or more of the PEP8 warnings you fixed. Does the resulting code look better or worse? Why?

```
    We fixed spacing around operators and ensured consistent indentation. The code looks better and is easier to read now.
```

## SECTION 2:

2.a. You should notice that there are multiple branches in the Github repository. Find yours and check that your code is there. 
     Compare your branch to master. What’s different?

```        
    The main difference is just that our branch only have what we have been working on. 
```


2.b. Do you see other groups’ branches in the repo as well? Is your code in their branch? Why or why not?

```        
   It's not yet, cause we need to issue a pull-request nad master has to pull it into the master branch.
```


2.c. Next, issue a pull request (this is done by clicking on "New Pull Request" button in the browser on Github). 
     A pull request is a formal request to add your code into the master branch, for all to see and share. 
     Once you’ve issued the pull request, communicate to the instructor that you are "ready for a PR review."
     After the instructor or TA approves your request, refresh Github. 
     Is your code in the master branch now? 

```
    
```


2.d. What about other groups’ code? Is it also in master branch, compared to the last time you looked at it in Question 2.b.?

```

```


2.e. Once your code has been pulled into the master branch, go back to PyCharm. 
     Right-click on the directory, and switch back to the master branch by clicking 
     **Git** >> **Branches** and selecting **Local Branches** >> **Master**.
     Is your code in your **local** master branch? Why not?

Git can be challenging to wrap your head around when you’re first learning it, 
especially when collaboration becomes a part of the process. 
So, let’s make sure we understand the basic terms; 
the details of using git will be touched upon again in your homework assignment, in more detail. 

2.f. Define Each Term:
```
        a. Clone: A copy of a repository from a remote source to your local machine.

        b. Commit:_A saved change or snapshot of the code in the repository, including a message describing the change.

        c. Push:_Uploading your local commits to a remote repository.
        
        d. Branch:_ A parallel version of the repository that allows for separate development without affecting the main codebase.

        e. Pull:_Downloading changes from a remote repository to your local machine.

        f. Pull Request: A request to merge changes from one branch into another, typically for review before merging.

        g. Merge:Combining changes from one branch into another, integrating the code.

        h. Remote:_A version of the repository that is hosted on a server, allowing collaboration with others.

        i. Local:The version of the repository that exists on your personal machine.

        j. Fetch:_Retrieving updates from a remote repository without merging them into your local branch.
```

Check your definitions against the [git glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) to ensure they are correct.

11. In Github, go to the [Network Graph](https://github.com/Berea-College-CSC-226/t04-master/network) (i.e., a history of branching and committing history). 
    Discuss with your partner what confusions you still have about the git workflow you experienced today, 
    using the network graph to explore what has happened. Write your unanswered questions in the space below:
