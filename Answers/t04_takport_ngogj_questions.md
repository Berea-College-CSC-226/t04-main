# Adventure To Gitland

## Instructions

**Replace each `**Replace This With Your Answer**` with your answer**


## SECTION 1:

1.a. Discuss with your partner two or more ways in which you've improved as a coder since T01. You can refer back to t01_final_story.py for "inspiration".

```        
    ** We improved as a coder by understanding what functions mean, learning how to determine different errors, and understanding what functions will do when you run a code. **
```


1.b. Briefly describe any logic changes you made in your code, and why you made them.

```
    **The logic changes we made in our code is fixing the if and else statements and isDead = False statement, because the code wouldn't run a certain option if the statement wasn't an else statement.**
```


1.c. Did you find it challenging following the logic of another group’s code? Why or why not?

```
    **Yes, we found it challenging following the logic of another group's code because at first, we didn't understand their intentions and idea behind the code, and we were confused. We had to keep testing the code and debug the code to understand their code.**
```


1.d. Briefly describe two or more of the PEP8 warnings you fixed. Does the resulting code look better or worse? Why?

```
    **The two PEP8 warnings that I fixed were delay = 1 and isDead = False. The resulting code looks better because it gives a clearer understanding of what the code wants to do and the code actually runs the program. **
```

## SECTION 2:

2.a. You should notice that there are multiple branches in the Github repository. Find yours and check that your code is there. 
     Compare your branch to master. What’s different?

```        
    **We compared each branch and the master had the corrections that we needed to fix our code once we compared the two. The difference was the master branch had the fixes that our code needed.**
```


2.b. Do you see other groups’ branches in the repo as well? Is your code in their branch? Why or why not?

```        
    **Yes, we see all the branches in the repo and yes we see our code in their branches as well.**
```


2.c. Next, issue a pull request (this is done by clicking on "New Pull Request" button in the browser on Github). 
     A pull request is a formal request to add your code into the master branch, for all to see and share. 
     Once you’ve issued the pull request, communicate to the instructor that you are "ready for a PR review."
     After the instructor or TA approves your request, refresh Github. 
     Is your code in the master branch now? 

```
    **Yes, our code is in the master branch.**
```


2.d. What about other groups’ code? Is it also in master branch, compared to the last time you looked at it in Question 2.b.?

```
**Yes, all the other groups' code is in the master branch.**
```


2.e. Once your code has been pulled into the master branch, go back to PyCharm. 
     Right-click on the directory, and switch back to the master branch by clicking 
     **Git** >> **Branches** and selecting **Local Branches** >> **Master**.
     Is your code in your **local** master branch? Why not?

```
    **Yes, our code is in the local master branch. **
```

Git can be challenging to wrap your head around when you’re first learning it, 
especially when collaboration becomes a part of the process. 
So, let’s make sure we understand the basic terms; 
the details of using git will be touched upon again in your homework assignment, in more detail. 

2.f. Define Each Term:
```
        a. Clone: A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. 

        b. Commit: A commit is a history of changes made to a project's files in a version control system, making it an important point in your development process where you want to save progress, which is done by tagging changes, or revisions, in a document. It needs a commit message to provide context and reasoning for the changes, helping others and myself understand what was modified and why.

        c. Push: To push your code means to save and upload the changes you’ve made, which saves on Github’s servers. The code is being pushed to the remote repository from the local repository.

        d. Branch: A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version.

        e. Pull: A pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.

        f. Pull Request: A pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators.

        g. Merge: A merge takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.

        h. Remote: A version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com.

        i. Local: A local refers to the repository that exists on your personal computer or local machine. It is essentially a copy of the project's codebase that you can work on independently of the remote repository.

        j. Fetch: You're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them. It fetching allows you to review changes before committing them to your local branch.
```

Check your definitions against the [git glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) to ensure they are correct.

11. In Github, go to the [Network Graph](https://github.com/Berea-College-CSC-226/t04-master/network) (i.e., a history of branching and committing history). 
    Discuss with your partner what confusions you still have about the git workflow you experienced today, 
    using the network graph to explore what has happened. Write your unanswered questions in the space below:

```
    **Can we see the commits of other branches? Can other groups access our branch and run our code? **
```
