# Adventure To Gitland

## Instructions

**Replace each `**Replace This With Your Answer**` with your answer**


## SECTION 1:

1.a. Discuss with your partner two or more ways in which you've improved as a coder since T01. You can refer back to t01_final_story.py for "inspiration".

```        
       My partner and I can both navigate through functions well and parse through the code efficienlty notice and fix errors. 

```


1.b. Briefly describe any logic changes you made in your code, and why you made them.

```
    Some logical changes we made to the code was that there was no tracking for the players state. In our refractered version we check for if the player isDead this provides a clear ending and allows retries or restarts. 
```


1.c. Did you find it challenging following the logic of another group’s code? Why or why not?

```
    Yes, we saw the function sleep() and got confused on where it was supposed to do but found out it's what delays the code. 
```


1.d. Briefly describe two or more of the PEP8 warnings you fixed. Does the resulting code look better or worse? Why?

```
    We added proper spacing and fixed variable names some were uppercase and would chnage them based on pycharms suggestion. Same thing for spacing and indentation. 
```

## SECTION 2:

2.a. You should notice that there are multiple branches in the Github repository. Find yours and check that your code is there. 
     Compare your branch to master. What’s different?

```        
    We see the code in  our branch but not in the master branch. The master branch is unedited 
```


2.b. Do you see other groups’ branches in the repo as well? Is your code in their branch? Why or why not?

```        
    We see other branches but our code is not in their branches becuase they are not merged. 
```


2.c. Next, issue a pull request (this is done by clicking on "New Pull Request" button in the browser on Github). 
     A pull request is a formal request to add your code into the master branch, for all to see and share. 
     Once you’ve issued the pull request, communicate to the instructor that you are "ready for a PR review."
     After the instructor or TA approves your request, refresh Github. 
     Is your code in the master branch now? 

```
     The code is in master after getting accepted through the pr
```


2.d. What about other groups’ code? Is it also in master branch, compared to the last time you looked at it in Question 2.b.?

```
Yes, for people who have completed the assignment
```


2.e. Once your code has been pulled into the master branch, go back to PyCharm. 
     Right-click on the directory, and switch back to the master branch by clicking 
     **Git** >> **Branches** and selecting **Local Branches** >> **Master**.
     Is your code in your **local** master branch? Why not?

```
    yes our code is in main, we also see other peoples codes in main
```

Git can be challenging to wrap your head around when you’re first learning it, 
especially when collaboration becomes a part of the process. 
So, let’s make sure we understand the basic terms; 
the details of using git will be touched upon again in your homework assignment, in more detail. 

2.f. Define Each Term:
```
        a. Clone:Compying the repostory in to pycharm 

        b. Commit:saving the changes made to the code

        c. Push:uploading the code to github

        d. Branch:seperating files to work independtly

        e. Pull:accepting the changes made online 

        f. Pull Request: asking to be merged to the main code

        g. Merge:combining codes together

        h. Remote:code from others that are not working together.

        i. Local:repository in pycharm 

        j. Fetch: getting all the changes made remotley 
```

Check your definitions against the [git glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) to ensure they are correct.

11. In Github, go to the [Network Graph](https://github.com/Berea-College-CSC-226/t04-master/network) (i.e., a history of branching and committing history). 
    Discuss with your partner what confusions you still have about the git workflow you experienced today, 
    using the network graph to explore what has happened. Write your unanswered questions in the space below:

```
    No questions.
