# Adventure To Gitland

## Instructions

**Replace each `**Replace This With Your Answer**` with your answer**


## SECTION 1:

1.a. Discuss with your partner two or more ways in which you've improved as a coder since T01. You can refer back to t01_final_story.py for "inspiration".

```        
    ** we understand easier ways to make a code run we also understand concepts better**
```


1.b. Briefly describe any logic changes you made in your code, and why you made them.

```
    **Deley veribal was miswritten also changed elif to else**
```


1.c. Did you find it challenging following the logic of another group’s code? Why or why not?

```
    ** no to challenging it was pretty much eassy to figure out **
```


1.d. Briefly describe two or more of the PEP8 warnings you fixed. Does the resulting code look better or worse? Why?

```
    **it really doesnt look like it made a differance but we fixed the comment that were made**
```

## SECTION 2:

2.a. You should notice that there are multiple branches in the Github repository. Find yours and check that your code is there. 
     Compare your branch to master. What’s different?

```        
    **the codes in the differant branchesr**
```


2.b. Do you see other groups’ branches in the repo as well? Is your code in their branch? Why or why not?

```        
    **no our code is not in there branches because its not main**
```


2.c. Next, issue a pull request (this is done by clicking on "New Pull Request" button in the browser on Github). 
     A pull request is a formal request to add your code into the master branch, for all to see and share. 
     Once you’ve issued the pull request, communicate to the instructor that you are "ready for a PR review."
     After the instructor or TA approves your request, refresh Github. 
     Is your code in the master branch now? 

```
    ** our code is in master now becasue our pr was good**
```


2.d. What about other groups’ code? Is it also in master branch, compared to the last time you looked at it in Question 2.b.?

```
**yes the people who have finshed **
```


2.e. Once your code has been pulled into the master branch, go back to PyCharm. 
     Right-click on the directory, and switch back to the master branch by clicking 
     **Git** >> **Branches** and selecting **Local Branches** >> **Master**.
     Is your code in your **local** master branch? Why not?

Git can be challenging to wrap your head around when you’re first learning it, 
especially when collaboration becomes a part of the process. 
So, let’s make sure we understand the basic terms; 
the details of using git will be touched upon again in your homework assignment, in more detail. 

2.f. Define Each Term:
```
        a. Clone: A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy

        b. Commit: saving the changes that we made

        c. Push:sending our changes to git hub

        d. Branch: it is a part of main like a tree branch 

        e. Pull:Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them

        f. Pull Request:same thing as pull but we have to ask permision from the owner of the repo

        g. Merge:combins my branch with main our takes one code and puts it in another

        h. Remote:This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com

        i. Local:same version of the repo just on our computer

        j. Fetch:you're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them.
```

Check your definitions against the [git glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) to ensure they are correct.

11. In Github, go to the [Network Graph](https://github.com/Berea-College-CSC-226/t04-master/network) (i.e., a history of branching and committing history). 
    Discuss with your partner what confusions you still have about the git workflow you experienced today, 
    using the network graph to explore what has happened. Write your unanswered questions in the space below:
