# Adventure To Gitland

**Replace each `**Replace This With Your Answer**` with your answer**

## How To Start:

        Driver: Galina Pokitko
        Navigator:Aliaksandr Melnichenko
        Quality Control (if necessary):____________

____


1. Discuss with your partner two or more ways in which you've improved as a coder since T01. You can refer back to t01_final_story.py for "inspiration".

```        
Compared back to week 1, we are able to now collaborate better with partners on teamwork assignments and understand the function of Pycharm better. Also, we learned more about functions and how to use main.
```


#SECTION 1:

2. Briefly describe any logic changes you made in your code, and why you made them.

```
We optimized syntax's and implemented new functions, for example we created a function called OurSleep for the sleep(delay) because it makes the code easier to work out.
```

___

3. Did you find it challenging following the logic of another group’s code? Why or why not?

```
We did not find the logic of another's group code challenging because there were comments along the way to explain the code.
```


___

4. Briefly describe two or more of the PEP8 warnings you fixed. Does the resulting code look better or worse? Why?

```
We fixed indentation and spacing errors, it makes the resulting code look better because it will not cause issues in the future.
```

___

#SECTION 2:

5. You should notice that there are multiple branches in the Github repository. Find yours and check that your code is there.

    Compare your branch to master. What’s different?

```        
Compared to master, our code has our pdf, answers, and refactored work because the main only includes what the main coder pulls (our work hasn't been pulled yet).
```

___

6. Do you see other groups’ branches in the repo as well? Is your code in their branch? Why or why not?

```        
We do see other group's branches but we do not see our code in their branch because our work isn't pulled to their branch (each branch is seperate).
```

___

7. Next, issue a pull request (this is done by clicking on "New Pull Request" button in the browser on Github). 

    A pull request is a formal request to add your code into the master branch, for all to see and share. Once you’ve issued the pull request, communicate to the instructor that you are "ready for a PR review."

    After the instructor or TA approves your request, refresh Github. 

    Is your code in the master branch now? 

```
Not yet, it was given feedback, it will be added when we add our pdf and answers.
```

___

8. What about other groups’ code? Is it also in master branch, compared to the last time you looked at it in Question 6?

```
The only groups that are in master are the ones that get approved by the main coder (Professor Heggens). 
```

___

9. Once your code has been pulled into the master branch, go back to PyCharm. Right click on the directory, and switch back to the master branch by clicking Git >> Branches and selecting “Local Branches” >> Master”.

    Is your code in your **local** master branch? Why not?

```
Yes, when the code is updated because the code is pulled into master branch.
```

___


#SECTION 3: Git Terminology:

10. Define Each Term:

        a. Clone: make a copy of local branch

        b. Commit: get ready to submit changes by leaving a note

        c. Push: sending changes to GitHub server

        d. Branch: local space of repository where you work on code

        e. Pull: you fetch changes and merge them

        f. Pull Request: asking the main coder to accept your branch into main branch

        g. Merge: updating code to have main branch in your local machine

        h. Remote: files and/or folders on server

        i. Local: files and/or folders in project

        j. Fetch: adding changes to local branch (not commiting them) from remote repository

    Check your definitions against the [git glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) to ensure they are correct.


___


11. In Github, go to the [Network Graph](https://github.com/Berea-College-CSC-226/t04-master/network) (i.e., a history of branching and committing history). 

    Discuss with your partner what confusions you still have about the git workflow you experienced today, using the network graph to explore what has happened. Write your unanswered questions in the space to the right:
    
        How can we determine which branches on the network graph are pulled into master?
