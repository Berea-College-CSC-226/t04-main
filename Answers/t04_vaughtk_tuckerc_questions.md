# Adventure To Gitland

## Instructions

**Replace each `**Replace This With Your Answer**` with your answer**


## SECTION 1:

1.a. Discuss with your partner two or more ways in which you've improved as a coder since T01. You can refer back to t01_final_story.py for "inspiration".

```        
    We learned to use functions to simplify code and we learned additional statements such as '.lower()'.
```


1.b. Briefly describe any logic changes you made in your code, and why you made them.

```
    Added a .lower() to allow more flexible input, added an else: statement to handle other input, and added return True and False statements to decide whether to proceed to another function
```


1.c. Did you find it challenging following the logic of another group’s code? Why or why not?

```
    This code was simple, so no.
```


1.d. Briefly describe two or more of the PEP8 warnings you fixed. Does the resulting code look better or worse? Why?

```
    Changed isDead to is_dead. Changed 'if is_dead == True:' to 'if is_dead:' The code looks neater due to the latter change.
```

## SECTION 2:

2.a. You should notice that there are multiple branches in the Github repository. Find yours and check that your code is there. 
     Compare your branch to master. What’s different?

```        
    Our branch contains our code file and our answers file. Master branch does not.
```


2.b. Do you see other groups’ branches in the repo as well? Is your code in their branch? Why or why not?

```        
    Yes, I see other groups' branches. Our code is not in those branches because the branches are separate.
```


2.c. Next, issue a pull request (this is done by clicking on "New Pull Request" button in the browser on Github). 
     A pull request is a formal request to add your code into the master branch, for all to see and share. 
     Once you’ve issued the pull request, communicate to the instructor that you are "ready for a PR review."
     After the instructor or TA approves your request, refresh Github. 
     Is your code in the master branch now? 

```
    Yes.
```


2.d. What about other groups’ code? Is it also in master branch, compared to the last time you looked at it in Question 2.b.?

```
    Yes, a couple groups' code and answer files are in the master branch.
```


2.e. Once your code has been pulled into the master branch, go back to PyCharm. 
     Right-click on the directory, and switch back to the master branch by clicking 
     **Git** >> **Branches** and selecting **Local Branches** >> **Master**.
     Is your code in your **local** master branch? Why not?

```
    No, it isn't in the local master branch until the local master branch has pulled from the remote master branch to update.
```

Git can be challenging to wrap your head around when you’re first learning it, 
especially when collaboration becomes a part of the process. 
So, let’s make sure we understand the basic terms; 
the details of using git will be touched upon again in your homework assignment, in more detail. 

2.f. Define Each Term:
```
        a. Clone: To copy a repository to your local device

        b. Commit: To save your changes as essentially a checkpoint with a note explaining what has changed

        c. Push: To push your local changes to GitHub

        d. Branch: A new copy of code that you can make modifications to before adding to the main code

        e. Pull: To get the most recent code changes from GitHub

        f. Pull Request: A request to have your code incorporated into the main branch

        g. Merge: To combine the code and files of two branches

        h. Remote: Not on your local device, such as in GitHub

        i. Local: Located on your personal computer and not on the cloud

        j. Fetch: Fetch is essentially a pull without merging anything
```

Check your definitions against the [git glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) to ensure they are correct.

11. In Github, go to the [Network Graph](https://github.com/Berea-College-CSC-226/t04-master/network) (i.e., a history of branching and committing history). 
    Discuss with your partner what confusions you still have about the git workflow you experienced today, 
    using the network graph to explore what has happened. Write your unanswered questions in the space below:

```
    We agree that we mostly understand the workflow. There is some confusion on how new changes don't require new PRs.
```
