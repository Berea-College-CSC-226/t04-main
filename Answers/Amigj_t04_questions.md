# Adventure To Gitland

## Instructions

**Replace each `**Replace This With Your Answer**` with your answer**


## SECTION 1:

1.a. Discuss with your partner two or more ways in which you've improved as a coder since T01. You can refer back to t01_final_story.py for "inspiration".

```        
    **Me and my partner didn't get our code done from the T01, so I had to make my own.**
```


1.b. Briefly describe any logic changes you made in your code, and why you made them.

```
    **We had a bit of code (only prints), so it was a massive change from choosing from doors to trying to escape your
    owner's house as a bird. I made the change because I thought it would be funny, and it adds to my lore of bird's secretly
    having a revolution to over throw humans one day.**
```


1.c. Did you find it challenging following the logic of another group’s code? Why or why not?

```
    **I found their logic interesting and inspiring for the way they used a if statement with a number input. Their code was easy to understand.**
```


1.d. Briefly describe two or more of the PEP8 warnings you fixed. Does the resulting code look better or worse? Why?

```
    **I fixed some personal PEP8 errors with my print statements and it makes my code way better and less confusing. With the extra
    indents, it makes the code look confusing.**
```

## SECTION 2:

2.a. You should notice that there are multiple branches in the Github repository. Find yours and check that your code is there. 
     Compare your branch to master. What’s different?

```        
    **Branch has my updated edits, however the master doesn't have my changes. **
```


2.b. Do you see other groups’ branches in the repo as well? Is your code in their branch? Why or why not?

```        
    **I cannot see other groups' works/branches.**
```


2.c. Next, issue a pull request (this is done by clicking on "New Pull Request" button in the browser on Github). 
     A pull request is a formal request to add your code into the master branch, for all to see and share. 
     Once you’ve issued the pull request, communicate to the instructor that you are "ready for a PR review."
     After the instructor or TA approves your request, refresh Github. 
     Is your code in the master branch now? 

```
    **No, but my code was commented on by the instructor. **
```


2.d. What about other groups’ code? Is it also in master branch, compared to the last time you looked at it in Question 2.b.?

```
**I can see two groups works in the master branch.**
```


2.e. Once your code has been pulled into the master branch, go back to PyCharm. 
     Right-click on the directory, and switch back to the master branch by clicking 
     **Git** >> **Branches** and selecting **Local Branches** >> **Master**.
     Is your code in your **local** master branch? Why not?

```
    **My code isn't pulled into the master branch, but I assume that your code would be in the local branch.**
```

Git can be challenging to wrap your head around when you’re first learning it, 
especially when collaboration becomes a part of the process. 
So, let’s make sure we understand the basic terms; 
the details of using git will be touched upon again in your homework assignment, in more detail. 

2.f. Define Each Term:
```
        a. Clone: making a copy (copy of a repo)

        b. Commit: saving your work 

        c. Push: sending your work (commits) to Git from PyCharm

        d. Branch: a copy of the master, but edits you make here won't change the master (parallel version of the repo)

        e. Pull: pulling work from Git to PyCharm (fetching changes from the remote repo.)

        f. Pull Request: requesting if your work can be pulled into the master branch (changes that can be accepted or denied by the repo collabatrors)

        g. Merge: put to things together like your branch with the updated master.

        h. Remote: distant/far away file. (verison of the branch/repo that is hosted on a server)

        i. Local:nearby/immdiate file in your computer.

        j. Fetch: To go get something
```

Check your definitions against the [git glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) to ensure they are correct.

11. In Github, go to the [Network Graph](https://github.com/Berea-College-CSC-226/t04-master/network) (i.e., a history of branching and committing history). 
    Discuss with your partner what confusions you still have about the git workflow you experienced today, 
    using the network graph to explore what has happened. Write your unanswered questions in the space below:

```
    **N/A questions**
