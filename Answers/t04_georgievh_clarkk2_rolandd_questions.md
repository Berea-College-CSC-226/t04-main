# Adventure To Gitland

## Instructions

**Replace each `**Replace This With Your Answer**` with your answer**


## SECTION 1:

1.a. Discuss with your partner two or more ways in which you've improved as a coder since T01. You can refer back to t01_final_story.py for "inspiration".

```        
    We know much more about python conventions and good practices, and we've of course learned a lot about python itself.
    We've become quicker at coding, and at parsing/reading code.
```


1.b. Briefly describe any logic changes you made in your code, and why you made them.

```
    We added a return statement so that the rest of the program knows wether or not the player is dead or not.
    We also passed in "direction" as a parameter, since the scope of that variable was not global.
```


1.c. Did you find it challenging following the logic of another group’s code? Why or why not?

```
    Somewhat, because we didn't know what assumptions they made and which variable is defined where,
    but it was also a pretty simple linear logic chain so it wasn't too hard to understand.
```


1.d. Briefly describe two or more of the PEP8 warnings you fixed. Does the resulting code look better or worse? Why?

```
Two spaces before defining functions. We fixed . It looks better because its more organized, readable, and sparkly.
```

## SECTION 2:

2.a. You should notice that there are multiple branches in the Github repository. Find yours and check that your code is there. 
     Compare your branch to master. What’s different?

```        
    **We have a file that we answered questions on.**
```


2.b. Do you see other groups’ branches in the repo as well? Is your code in their branch? Why or why not?

```        
    No, our code has not been merged into main. We can see theirs becausse their code has resolved the pull request.
```


2.c. Next, issue a pull request (this is done by clicking on "New Pull Request" button in the browser on Github). 
     A pull request is a formal request to add your code into the master branch, for all to see and share. 
     Once you’ve issued the pull request, communicate to the instructor that you are "ready for a PR review."
     After the instructor or TA approves your request, refresh Github. 
     Is your code in the master branch now? 

```
    No, we had some issues that we needed to fix before hand. 
```


2.d. What about other groups’ code? Is it also in master branch, compared to the last time you looked at it in Question 2.b.?

```
Yes, some groups have been merged into master.
```


2.e. Once your code has been pulled into the master branch, go back to PyCharm. 
     Right-click on the directory, and switch back to the master branch by clicking 
     **Git** >> **Branches** and selecting **Local Branches** >> **Master**.
     Is your code in your **local** master branch? Why not?

```

Git can be challenging to wrap your head around when you’re first learning it, 
especially when collaboration becomes a part of the process. 
So, let’s make sure we understand the basic terms; 
the details of using git will be touched upon again in your homework assignment, in more detail. 

2.f. Define Each Term:
```
        a. Clone: Local copy of a remote repository.

        b. Commit: Snapshot of changes with a descriptive message.

        c. Push: Upload local changes to a remote repository.

        d. Branch: Separate line of development in a repository.

        e. Pull: Download latest changes from a remote repository.

        f. Pull Request: Propose changes for review and discussion.

        g. Merge: Combine changes from multiple branches.

        h. Remote: Central location of the project

        i. Local: Personal copy of the project on your computer.

        j. Fetch: Download latest data from a remote repository without merging.
```

Check your definitions against the [git glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) to ensure they are correct.

11. In Github, go to the [Network Graph](https://github.com/Berea-College-CSC-226/t04-master/network) (i.e., a history of branching and committing history). 
    Discuss with your partner what confusions you still have about the git workflow you experienced today, 
    using the network graph to explore what has happened. Write your unanswered questions in the space below:
