# Adventure To Gitland

**Replace each `**Replace This With Your Answer**` with your answer**

## How To Start:

        Quality Control (if necessary):____________

____


1. Discuss with your partner two or more ways in which you've improved as a coder since T01. You can refer back to t01_final_story.py for "inspiration".

```        
**I have become better at making a more readable code using functions, comments, and spaces. We also know more methods.**
```


#SECTION 1:

2. Briefly describe any logic changes you made in your code, and why you made them.

```
** we added docstrings and comments to make it more readable, we changed the direction options where you can only choose North. We moved the code in the define code part.**
```

___

3. Did you find it challenging following the logic of another group’s code? Why or why not?

```
** It wasn't that challenging but the fact you had limited choices(1) was a bit confusing at first.**
```


___

4. Briefly describe two or more of the PEP8 warnings you fixed. Does the resulting code look better or worse? Why?

```
** we added a docstring, and we added comments**
```

___

#SECTION 2:

5. You should notice that there are multiple branches in the Github repository. Find yours and check that your code is there.

    Compare your branch to master. What’s different?

```        
**Our branch doesn't have as much code as the master branch. We only have our teams code, aswell as the changes made to that original code.**
```

___

6. Do you see other groups’ branches in the repo as well? Is your code in their branch? Why or why not?

```        
**We can see other groups branches in the repo, but our code has not been brought over into their branch. They aren't working on the same code as us, so they won't have our code in their branch.**
```

___

7. Next, issue a pull request (this is done by clicking on "New Pull Request" button in the browser on Github). 

    A pull request is a formal request to add your code into the master branch, for all to see and share. Once you’ve issued the pull request, communicate to the instructor that you are "ready for a PR review."

    After the instructor or TA approves your request, refresh Github. 

    Is your code in the master branch now? 

```
**Our code isn't in the master branch yet, as our changes have not been approved**
```

___

8. What about other groups’ code? Is it also in master branch, compared to the last time you looked at it in Question 6?

```
**Other peoples code does appear to be in the master branch**
```

___

9. Once your code has been pulled into the master branch, go back to PyCharm. Right click on the directory, and switch back to the master branch by clicking Git >> Branches and selecting “Local Branches” >> Master”.

    Is your code in your **local** master branch? Why not?

```
**Our code has not been pulled into the master branch yet, as we still had two things we needed to fic before we could be pulled over.**
```

___


#SECTION 3: Git Terminology:

10. Define Each Term:

        a. Clone: Copy of repository on computer

        b. Commit: change to file

        c. Push: Pushing code to a directory to save progress

        d. Branch: alternative place to test code/write code instead of on the master branch

        e. Pull: code gets brought into other branches

        f. Pull Request: Asking for our code to be looked over and added to the master branch through github.

        g. Merge: applied changes from one branch to another

        h. Remote: version of repository on a branch

        i. Local: This is the device you are creating code on

        j. Fetch: adding changes from remote repository to local branch without commiting/pushing them

    Check your definitions against the [git glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) to ensure they are correct.


___


11. In Github, go to the [Network Graph](https://github.com/Berea-College-CSC-226/t04-master/network) (i.e., a history of branching and committing history). 

    Discuss with your partner what confusions you still have about the git workflow you experienced today, using the network graph to explore what has happened. Write your unanswered questions in the space to the right:
    
        **We are still a bit confused on merging code.**
