        Quality Control (if necessary):____________

____


1. Discuss with your partner two or more ways in which you've improved as a coder since T01. You can refer back to t01_final_story.py for "inspiration".

```        
**I have become better at making a more readable code using functions, comments, and spaces. We also know more methods.**
```


#SECTION 1:

2. Briefly describe any logic changes you made in your code, and why you made them.

```
** we added docstrings and comments to make it more readable, we changed the direction options where you can only choose North. We moved the code in the define code part.**
```

___

3. Did you find it challenging following the logic of another group’s code? Why or why not?

```
** It wasn't that challenging but the fact you had limited choices(1) was a bit confusing at first.**
```


___

4. Briefly describe two or more of the PEP8 warnings you fixed. Does the resulting code look better or worse? Why?

```
** we added a docstring and we added comments**
```

___

#SECTION 2:

5. You should notice that there are multiple branches in the Github repository. Find yours and check that your code is there.

    Compare your branch to master. What’s different?

6. Do you see other groups’ branches in the repo as well? Is your code in their branch? Why or why not?

```

___

7. Next, issue a pull request (this is done by clicking on "New Pull Request" button in the browser on Github). 

    A pull request is a formal request to add your code into the master branch, for all to see and share. Once you’ve issued the pull request, communicate to the instructor that you are "ready for a PR review."

    After the instructor or TA approves your request, refresh Github. 

    Is your code in the master branch now? 

```

```

___

9. Once your code has been pulled into the master branch, go back to PyCharm. Right click on the directory, and switch back to the master branch by clicking Git >> Branches and selecting “Local Branches” >> Master”.

    Is your code in your **local** master branch? Why not?

11. In Github, go to the [Network Graph](https://github.com/Berea-College-CSC-226/t04-master/network) (i.e., a history of branching and committing history). 

    Discuss with your partner what confusions you still have about the git workflow you experienced today, using the network graph to explore what has happened. Write your unanswered questions in the space to the right:
