# Adventure To Gitland

## Instructions

**Replace each `**Replace This With Your Answer**` with your answer**


## SECTION 1:

1.a. Discuss with your partner two or more ways in which you've improved as a coder since T01. You can refer back to t01_final_story.py for "inspiration".

```        
    We fixed variables names, if-statements and general logic of the code.
```


1.b. Briefly describe any logic changes you made in your code, and why you made them.

```
    We changed position of the input() function, because it was called to early in the code. 
    We changed if statements, so they produce correct result.
```


1.c. Did you find it challenging following the logic of another group’s code? Why or why not?

```
    We found it challenging, because the logic of the code was broken.
```


1.d. Briefly describe two or more of the PEP8 warnings you fixed. Does the resulting code look better or worse? Why?

```
    We got two syntax errors regarding naming of the variables. Resulting code looks much better, because we fixed its structure and logic.
```

## SECTION 2:

2.a. You should notice that there are multiple branches in the Github repository. Find yours and check that your code is there. 
     Compare your branch to master. What’s different?

```        
    We have our own documents in our branch, while master has initial documents. 
```


2.b. Do you see other groups’ branches in the repo as well? Is your code in their branch? Why or why not?

```        
    We can see other groups' code in the master repository, however their code isn't in our branch. 
    Our branch is our own version of the program, and until we merge it with master, it wouldn't have other people's files.
```


2.c. Next, issue a pull request (this is done by clicking on "New Pull Request" button in the browser on Github). 
     A pull request is a formal request to add your code into the master branch, for all to see and share. 
     Once you’ve issued the pull request, communicate to the instructor that you are "ready for a PR review."
     After the instructor or TA approves your request, refresh Github. 
     Is your code in the master branch now? 

```

```


2.d. What about other groups’ code? Is it also in master branch, compared to the last time you looked at it in Question 2.b.?

```

```


2.e. Once your code has been pulled into the master branch, go back to PyCharm. 
     Right-click on the directory, and switch back to the master branch by clicking 
     **Git** >> **Branches** and selecting **Local Branches** >> **Master**.
     Is your code in your **local** master branch? Why not?

Git can be challenging to wrap your head around when you’re first learning it, 
especially when collaboration becomes a part of the process. 
So, let’s make sure we understand the basic terms; 
the details of using git will be touched upon again in your homework assignment, in more detail. 

2.f. Define Each Term:
```
        a. Clone:____________________

        b. Commit:____________________

        c. Push:____________________

        d. Branch:____________________

        e. Pull:____________________

        f. Pull Request:____________________

        g. Merge:____________________

        h. Remote:____________________

        i. Local:____________________

        j. Fetch:____________________
```

Check your definitions against the [git glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) to ensure they are correct.

11. In Github, go to the [Network Graph](https://github.com/Berea-College-CSC-226/t04-master/network) (i.e., a history of branching and committing history). 
    Discuss with your partner what confusions you still have about the git workflow you experienced today, 
    using the network graph to explore what has happened. Write your unanswered questions in the space below:
