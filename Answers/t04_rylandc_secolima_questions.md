# Adventure To Gitland

## Instructions

**Replace each `**Replace This With Your Answer**` with your answer**


## SECTION 1:

1.a. Discuss with your partner two or more ways in which you've improved as a coder since T01. You can refer back to t01_final_story.py for "inspiration".

```        
    Now we are able to visualize where in the code we can implement functions and loops,
    and we learned to not implement global variables.
```


1.b. Briefly describe any logic changes you made in your code, and why you made them.

```
    We corrected some missing if statements and deleted local variables mentioned by the professor.
    We simplified the if statements in the code as well.
```


1.c. Did you find it challenging following the logic of another group’s code? Why or why not?

```
    Yes. We just needed to figure out the logic.
```


1.d. Briefly describe two or more of the PEP8 warnings you fixed. Does the resulting code look better or worse? Why?

```
    We got rid of placeholders and moved the reference link into the docstring. It looked better as we made the logic clearer and easier to understand.
```

## SECTION 2:

2.a. You should notice that there are multiple branches in the Github repository. Find yours and check that your code is there. 
     Compare your branch to master. What’s different?

```        
    Our code and answers are not in the master
```


2.b. Do you see other groups’ branches in the repo as well? Is your code in their branch? Why or why not?

```        
   Yes. No, because our code it's only in our own branch.
```


2.c. Next, issue a pull request (this is done by clicking on "New Pull Request" button in the browser on Github). 
     A pull request is a formal request to add your code into the master branch, for all to see and share. 
     Once you’ve issued the pull request, communicate to the instructor that you are "ready for a PR review."
     After the instructor or TA approves your request, refresh Github. 
     Is your code in the master branch now? 

```
     Yes, because our branch has been merged into master.
```


2.d. What about other groups’ code? Is it also in master branch, compared to the last time you looked at it in Question 2.b.?

```
  After the PR, they're all in the master branch as their branch was merged 
  into master.
```


2.e. Once your code has been pulled into the master branch, go back to PyCharm. 
     Right-click on the directory, and switch back to the master branch by clicking 
     **Git** >> **Branches** and selecting **Local Branches** >> **Master**.
     Is your code in your **local** master branch? Why not?

```
    No. It's in the origin since it's already merged.
```

Git can be challenging to wrap your head around when you’re first learning it, 
especially when collaboration becomes a part of the process. 
So, let’s make sure we understand the basic terms; 
the details of using git will be touched upon again in your homework assignment, in more detail. 

2.f. Define Each Term:
```
        a. Clone: making a copy from the code on Github in a local computer

        b. Commit: confirming changes in the code to send them to Github

        c. Push: sending changes in the code to Github

        d. Branch: a scratch copy of the master branch in which I can work on

        e. Pull: updating my project by bringing changes made in a remote 
        repository to my local computer

        f. Pull Request: a formal request to merge my code, changes, or 
        projects into the main branch (master)

        g. Merge: blend my branch and master as one

        h. Remote: everything that's online, such as the online repository, 
        master branch, etc

        i. Local: everything that's in a local machine, such as the local 
        branch, code changes, etc

        j. Fetch: bringings all the changes from the remote repository 
        without actually downloading them.
```

Check your definitions against the [git glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) to ensure they are correct.

11. In Github, go to the [Network Graph](https://github.com/Berea-College-CSC-226/t04-master/network) (i.e., a history of branching and committing history). 
    Discuss with your partner what confusions you still have about the git workflow you experienced today, 
    using the network graph to explore what has happened. Write your unanswered questions in the space below:

```
    N/A
```
