# Adventure To Gitland

## Instructions

**Replace each `**Replace This With Your Answer**` with your answer**


## SECTION 1:

1.a. Discuss with your partner two or more ways in which you've improved as a coder since T01. You can refer back to t01_final_story.py for "inspiration".

```        
    We learned how to use functions to organize our source code and write a clean, reusable code
    We leared to use modules that help us acheive tasks instead of doing everything from scratch
```


1.b. Briefly describe any logic changes you made in your code, and why you made them.

```
    Defined dead variable outside the if statements at the beginning of the function as False.
    Defined a  delay = 1.0 variable as it was not in the function
```


1.c. Did you find it challenging following the logic of another group’s code? Why or why not?

```
    **Sometimes it is hard to follow the logic becuase different people use different ways of using the logics and code patterns.**
```


1.d. Briefly describe two or more of the PEP8 warnings you fixed. Does the resulting code look better or worse? Why?

```
    **Some of the function varibles contained extra pieces in them like quotations, and commas. One of of the if statement was also wrong which would give a different output. **
```

## SECTION 2:

2.a. You should notice that there are multiple branches in the Github repository. Find yours and check that your code is there. 
     Compare your branch to master. What’s different?

```        
    **The master branch is the main branch**
```


2.b. Do you see other groups’ branches in the repo as well? Is your code in their branch? Why or why not?

```        
    Yes, we can see other team's branches. And no, our code is not in the branch. Probably because it is their own branch with their own version of code on it.
```


2.c. Next, issue a pull request (this is done by clicking on "New Pull Request" button in the browser on Github). 
     A pull request is a formal request to add your code into the master branch, for all to see and share. 
     Once you’ve issued the pull request, communicate to the instructor that you are "ready for a PR review."
     After the instructor or TA approves your request, refresh Github. 
     Is your code in the master branch now? 

```
When refreshed, the code will be in the master branch. The pull was not approved though, Dr. Heggen edited it and we made changes.
```


2.d. What about other groups’ code? Is it also in master branch, compared to the last time you looked at it in Question 2.b.?

```
For those whose pull request was approved, their code was in the master branch.
```


2.e. Once your code has been pulled into the master branch, go back to PyCharm. 
     Right-click on the directory, and switch back to the master branch by clicking 
     **Git** >> **Branches** and selecting **Local Branches** >> **Master**.
     Is your code in your **local** master branch? Why not?

```
No, because we did not clone the remote master branch. Therefore, the code we have is still not updated to what's in the remote master.
```

Git can be challenging to wrap your head around when you’re first learning it, 
especially when collaboration becomes a part of the process. 
So, let’s make sure we understand the basic terms; 
the details of using git will be touched upon again in your homework assignment, in more detail. 

2.f. Define Each Term:
```
        a. Clone: Make an indivisual copy from the remote server on Github to my local one.

        b. Commit: Update and save changes of my code to the branch

        c. Push: Send the updated code I have on my local branch to the remote one on Github

        d. Branch: My own copy of codebase that I can edit without affecting anyone's code, until we merge more than one branch

        e. Pull: Download the code and updates it on my local machine fomr the remote one

        f. Pull Request: Asking the the repo owner to merge our codebase with the master branch

        g. Merge: combine two branches together into own by updating changes and resolving conflicts.

        h. Remote: The branches on Github that are shared with other member of the team
        
        i. Local: The branches that I have on my local machine

        j. Fetch: Download and commits the code
```

Check your definitions against the [git glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) to ensure they are correct.

11. In Github, go to the [Network Graph](https://github.com/Berea-College-CSC-226/t04-master/network) (i.e., a history of branching and committing history). 
    Discuss with your partner what confusions you still have about the git workflow you experienced today, 
    using the network graph to explore what has happened. Write your unanswered questions in the space below:

```
    We are still confused about Update in Pycharm, but we are all good and we kinda understand it, somewhat. 
```
