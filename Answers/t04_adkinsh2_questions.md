# Adventure To Gitland

## Instructions

**Replace each `**Replace This With Your Answer**` with your answer**


## SECTION 1:

1.a. Discuss with your partner two or more ways in which you've improved as a coder since T01. You can refer back to t01_final_story.py for "inspiration".

```        
    **I have become better at recognizing mistakes in my code and how I can better organize my work for someone else reading my code.**
```


1.b. Briefly describe any logic changes you made in your code, and why you made them.

```
    **I realized that I was comparing a string to an integer so I had to convert it to make it work.**
```


1.c. Did you find it challenging following the logic of another group’s code? Why or why not?

```
    **For the most part, everyone else's code is super similar in the sense that they are using the same functions, so it isn't hard to see how they created their code.**
```


1.d. Briefly describe two or more of the PEP8 warnings you fixed. Does the resulting code look better or worse? Why?

```
    **I fixed some suggestions in my docstring and also shorten an if statement as comparing a boolean variable to true is redundant.**
```

## SECTION 2:

2.a. You should notice that there are multiple branches in the Github repository. Find yours and check that your code is there. 
     Compare your branch to master. What’s different?

```        
    **My code has been added to to the refactor file.**
```


2.b. Do you see other groups’ branches in the repo as well? Is your code in their branch? Why or why not?

```        
    **Yes, each group has their own code inside their own personal branches to prevent us from changing other peoples code.**
```


2.c. Next, issue a pull request (this is done by clicking on "New Pull Request" button in the browser on Github). 
     A pull request is a formal request to add your code into the master branch, for all to see and share. 
     Once you’ve issued the pull request, communicate to the instructor that you are "ready for a PR review."
     After the instructor or TA approves your request, refresh Github. 
     Is your code in the master branch now? 

```
    **No, because the instructor must review and accept my pull request first.**
```


2.d. What about other groups’ code? Is it also in master branch, compared to the last time you looked at it in Question 2.b.?

```
**I am still not seeing other students code, their pull requests must have also not been accept into master.**
```


2.e. Once your code has been pulled into the master branch, go back to PyCharm. 
     Right-click on the directory, and switch back to the master branch by clicking 
     **Git** >> **Branches** and selecting **Local Branches** >> **Master**.
     Is your code in your **local** master branch? Why not?

```
    **Yes, it has been added to the main branch with everyone elses code.**
```

Git can be challenging to wrap your head around when you’re first learning it, 
especially when collaboration becomes a part of the process. 
So, let’s make sure we understand the basic terms; 
the details of using git will be touched upon again in your homework assignment, in more detail. 

2.f. Define Each Term:
```
        a. Clone: Make a personal copy

        b. Commit: Save changes to branch

        c. Push: Send commited code to github

        d. Branch: Copies of code for editing on local

        e. Pull: Grab pushed code into the origin branch

        f. Pull Request: Request for your code to be added to the master branch

        g. Merge: Combine code from your local branch to another branch

        h. Remote: The github servers, where origin is

        i. Local: Your computer that you work on

        j. Fetch: Adds changes from origin without commiting them
```

Check your definitions against the [git glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) to ensure they are correct.

11. In Github, go to the [Network Graph](https://github.com/Berea-College-CSC-226/t04-master/network) (i.e., a history of branching and committing history). 
    Discuss with your partner what confusions you still have about the git workflow you experienced today, 
    using the network graph to explore what has happened. Write your unanswered questions in the space below:

```
    **For administrators or moderators of a repo, can they work on the same branch in order to review all code or does everyone have to work on their own branch.**
```
