## SECTION 2:

2.a. You should notice that there are multiple branches in the Github repository. Find yours and check that your code is there. 
     Compare your branch to master. What’s different?

2.b. Do you see other groups’ branches in the repo as well? Is your code in their branch? Why or why not?

```        
    **Replace This With Your Answer**
```


2.c. Next, issue a pull request (this is done by clicking on "New Pull Request" button in the browser on Github). 
     A pull request is a formal request to add your code into the master branch, for all to see and share. 
     Once you’ve issued the pull request, communicate to the instructor that you are "ready for a PR review."
     After the instructor or TA approves your request, refresh Github. 
     Is your code in the master branch now? 

```
    **Replace This With Your Answer**
```


2.d. What about other groups’ code? Is it also in master branch, compared to the last time you looked at it in Question 2.b.?

```

```


2.e. Once your code has been pulled into the master branch, go back to PyCharm. 
     Right-click on the directory, and switch back to the master branch by clicking 
     **Git** >> **Branches** and selecting **Local Branches** >> **Master**.
     Is your code in your **local** master branch? Why not?

Git can be challenging to wrap your head around when you’re first learning it, 
especially when collaboration becomes a part of the process. 
So, let’s make sure we understand the basic terms; 
the details of using git will be touched upon again in your homework assignment, in more detail. 

2.f. Define Each Term:
```
        a. Clone: 

        b. Commit: 
        
        c. Push: 
        
        d. Branch: 
        
        e. Pull: 
       
        f. Pull Request: 

        g. Merge: 

        h. Remote: 

        i. Local:

Check your definitions against the [git glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) to ensure they are correct.

11. In Github, go to the [Network Graph](https://github.com/Berea-College-CSC-226/t04-master/network) (i.e., a history of branching and committing history). 
    Discuss with your partner what confusions you still have about the git workflow you experienced today, 
    using the network graph to explore what has happened. Write your unanswered questions in the space below:
